# References Folder

This folder contains reference materials, standards, and documentation to support MANET development for bomb disposal operations.

## Folder Purpose

Per project instructions (CLAUDE.md):
> "check the references folder before each task"

This directory serves as the authoritative source for:
- OSINT documentation standards
- HDS training references
- Bomb disposal operational procedures
- Meshtastic technical documentation
- Industry standards and best practices

## Organization

## OSINT Standards Compliance

All materials in this folder and referenced during development must adhere to OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) documentation standards:

- **Source Attribution:** Clearly cite all information sources
- **Collection Date:** Document when information was gathered
- **Reliability Assessment:** Rate source reliability and information credibility
- **Chain of Custody:** Maintain clear documentation trail
- **Classification:** Mark sensitivity level appropriately
- **Incident-Specific:** No synthetic or hypothetical incidents

## Required Reference Materials

### High Priority
- [ ] Meshtastic official documentation (download/link)
- [ ] LoRa frequency regulations for operational regions
- [ ] HDS bomb technician procedures and protocols
- [ ] OSINT intelligence report templates and standards
- [ ] Hardware datasheets for selected devices

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Mesh networking best practices
- [ ] Encryption standards documentation
- [ ] GPS integration specifications
- [ ] Battery and power management guides
- [ ] Ruggedization and environmental protection standards

### Lower Priority
- [ ] Case studies from similar implementations
- [ ] Academic research on MANET applications
- [ ] Community best practices from Meshtastic users
- [ ] Alternative platform comparisons

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Before Each Task:** Review relevant references for the task at hand
2. **During Development:** Reference materials to ensure compliance with standards
3. **Documentation:** Cite references in all technical documents and reports
4. **Updates:** Keep materials current with latest versions
5. **OSINT Compliance:** Follow OSINT standards for all intelligence analysis

## Adding New References

When adding materials to this folder:

1. Use clear, descriptive filenames
2. Include metadata (source, date, version)
3. Organize into appropriate subdirectories
4. Update this README with new additions
5. Ensure materials are properly licensed for use
6. Follow OSINT documentation standards

## Restricted Materials

Some reference materials may be:
- Proprietary to Improvised Electronics
- Subject to HDS training access restrictions
- Export-controlled technical data
- Law enforcement sensitive information

Maintain appropriate access controls and handling procedures.
