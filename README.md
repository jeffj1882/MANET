# MANET - Meshtastic Development Project
## Improvised Electronics

Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) development for civilian emergency response and disaster communications using Meshtastic LoRa mesh networking platform.

## Project Overview

This project develops resilient communications infrastructure for emergency response, disaster relief, search and rescue, and community preparedness using Meshtastic's open-source mesh networking platform. The system provides secure, off-grid communications for incident response, personnel safety, and coordination when traditional infrastructure is unavailable or compromised.

## Key Features

- **Off-Grid Operations:** No cellular or internet dependency
- **Extended Range:** LoRa technology provides multi-kilometer coverage (5-30km+)
- **Mesh Resilience:** Decentralized architecture with automatic healing
- **Encrypted Communications:** AES-256 encryption for sensitive operations
- **GPS Integration:** Real-time location tracking and incident mapping
- **Civilian Focus:** Designed for disaster response, search & rescue, wildfire response, community preparedness

## Quick Start

### New to Meshtastic?

**Start here!** 👉 [First Project Guide](docs/FIRST_PROJECT_GUIDE.md)

Complete beginner-friendly tutorial that walks you through:
- Choosing hardware
- Setting up your first 2-node mesh network
- Sending messages and tracking positions
- Building your first Python application

**Time:** 2-4 hours | **Cost:** $60-150

Also check out the [Quick Reference Card](docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for common commands.

### For MANET Project Development

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Meshtastic hardware devices (see DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md)
- Basic understanding of LoRa mesh networking

### Installation
```bash
# Install Meshtastic Python SDK
pip install meshtastic

# Clone or navigate to project
cd /Users/jeffjennings/Documents/MANET
```

### Initial Setup
1. Review `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` for complete development framework
2. Check `references/` folder for OSINT standards and materials
3. Follow Phase 1 objectives to establish development environment
4. Order hardware from approved vendor list (TBD in Phase 1)

## Development Phases

1. **Foundation & Research** (Weeks 1-2)
2. **Prototype Development** (Weeks 3-6)
3. **Operational Integration** (Weeks 7-10)
4. **Field Testing & Validation** (Weeks 11-14)
5. **Deployment & Training** (Weeks 15-16)

See `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` for detailed objectives and deliverables.

## Target Audience

This system is designed for:
- Emergency response teams (fire, EMS, law enforcement)
- Search and rescue organizations
- Disaster relief agencies (FEMA, Red Cross, etc.)
- Community emergency response teams (CERT)
- Wildfire response teams
- Rural and remote communities
- Event coordinators requiring reliable communications

## Security & Compliance

- All intelligence reports are incident-specific (no synthetic incidents)
- OSINT document standards followed for all analysis
- Encrypted communications for operational security
- Role-based access control for sensitive data
- Compliance with ICS (Incident Command System) standards
- FEMA disaster response protocol compatibility
