## Regular Update Workflow

### When to Commit & Push

Commit and push changes to GitHub after:
- Completing a development milestone
- Adding new documentation
- Creating new features or tools
- Updating hardware configurations
- Completing field test reports
- Making significant bug fixes

### Commit Message Standards

Follow this format for commit messages:

```
<type>: <brief description>

<detailed description if needed>

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `hardware`: Hardware configuration changes
- `incident`: Incident reports or analysis

**Examples:**
```
feat: Add Python SDK integration for device management

- Implement device discovery
- Add channel configuration helpers

```

### Stage Changes
```bash
# Stage specific files
git add <filename>

# Stage all changes
git add .
```

### Commit Changes

```

### Pull Latest Changes
```bash
git pull origin main
```

## Branch Strategy

For now, we're using a simple single-branch strategy:
- **main** - Production-ready code and documentation

As the project grows, consider:
- **develop** - Active development branch
- **feature/** - Feature-specific branches
- **hardware/** - Hardware testing branches
- **docs/** - Documentation updates

---

## Development Phases Tracking

Mark progress in `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` as you complete objectives:

### Phase 1: Foundation & Research (Weeks 1-2)
- Update checkboxes as deliverables are completed
- Commit when phase objectives are met
- Push to track progress publicly

### Subsequent Phases
- Follow same pattern for Phases 2-5
- Regular commits show project momentum
- Documentation of lessons learned

---

## File Organization Standards

### Source Code (`/src`)
- Python scripts for Meshtastic integration
- Configuration management tools
- Automated reporting scripts

### Documentation (`/docs`)
- Technical guides
- Hardware specifications
- Operational procedures
- Field test reports

### References (`/references`)
- OSINT materials (check .gitignore for sensitive items)
- Standards and regulations
- Training materials
- Research papers

### Incidents (`/incidents`)
- Incident-specific reports (OSINT standards)
- After-action reviews
- **Note:** Sensitive incident data should be in .gitignore

### Hardware (`/hardware`)
- Device configurations
- Firmware versions
- Antenna specifications
- Deployment diagrams

---

## Security Considerations

### What NOT to Commit

The `.gitignore` file protects:
- API keys and credentials
- Sensitive incident data
- Proprietary reference materials
- Deployed configuration details

### Before Committing
1. Review changes: `git diff`
2. Check for sensitive data
3. Ensure OSINT compliance
4. Verify no credentials included
